# FancyTab

A fancier version of a new tab!

FancyTab is simply a nicer, or fancier version of chrome's new tabs.

With this extension you can:

- Change the tab's background
- Change your name
- View your city's weather
- View your recent web pages
- Search using DuckDuckGo

**The store-version branch does not have the weather API due to the API key being registered under a free license for demonstration purposes.**

If you would still like to try it out with the weather, follow these steps:
1. Download the Master version zip from here. 
2. After unzipped to wherever you choose, open your browser.
3. Click your Chrome browser settings button(three dots, top right)
4. Go into More tools, then click Extensions
5. Make sure Developer Mode is turned on
6. Click Load Unpacked
7. Find the unzipped project you just downloaded, make sure you have the "public" folder inside selected
8. To choose or change your settings, you can either go to details under the extension name and click Extension Options, or put the extension next to your URL bar and select it like that
